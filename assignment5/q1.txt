Explain the difference between final and finally in Java 8

Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed. 
Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. Finalize 
is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected
